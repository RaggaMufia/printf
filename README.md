The first project in the Unix 1 module.

I am required to reproduce the behaviour of the Standard C library function printf()
A function that takes in variable number of arguments as formal parameters and produces output to the standard output, usually connected to the screen

The main part of the project is to be able to handle formatted arguments that then print out the corresponding arguments as the type specified by the format to be converted. For example, if the formatted argument is "%s", the corresponding argument will be printed out as a string, and this is true for each of the other types as well.

Success and failure depends largely on how accurate it is to that of the system's library
