The first project in the Unix 1 module.

I am required to reproduce the behaviour of the Standard C library function printf()
A function that takes in variable number of arguments as formal parameters and produces output to the standard output, usually connected to the screen

Success and failure depends largely on how accurate it is to that of the system's library
